# Persistent Mu

This repository stores code and data for the Persistent Mu project, which aims to provide flexible language-independent run-time support for persistence in managed languages (languages with automatic storage management, threads, etc.)

Persistent Mu aims to develop a specification and prototype implementation of persistence, as an extension of the Mu language-independent virtual machine.  The project is supported by Award CSR-1909731 from the National Science Foundation, titled "CNS Core: Small: Managed Languages: From Non-Volatile Memory to Persistence".

Please see the [rationale](https://github.com/umass-moss-lab/persistent-mu/blob/master/RATIONALE.md)  and [abstract](https://github.com/umass-moss-lab/persistent-mu/blob/master/ABSTRACT.md) for further description.

At present there is no additional code or data in this repository.
