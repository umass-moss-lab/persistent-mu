# Persistent-Mu
Stores code, data, for the Persistent Mu project, which aims to provide flexible language-independent run-time support for persistence in managed languages (languages with automatic storage management, threads, etc.)

Persistent Mu aims to develop a specification and prototype implementation of persistence, as an extension of the Mu language-independent virtual machine.  The project is expected to be supported by a pending grant from the National Science Foundation.

Please see the [rationale](https://github.com/umass-moss-lab/persistent-mu/blob/master/RATIONALE.md) for further description.

At present there is no additional code or data in this repository.
